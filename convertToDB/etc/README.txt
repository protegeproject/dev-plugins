To use the OWL to DB conversion script, please copy the following files in a directory:
- build.xml
- convert.properties.template

Rename convert.properties.template to convert.properties and edit the property values in the file (this is how you specify the input arguments).

To run the script, you will need ant. To run, start a console, change to the directory where you copied the two files and type ant in the console.
